# Page-Crawler

# About
This is a small backend project working with Python and the python pacakge Scrapy and web crawlers. This was my first time working with scrapy and web crawlers and it was very informative. Here I decided to scrape a wikipedia page for information and offline viewing.

# Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Scrapy

# Future Development
I would like to work more with web crawlers and in the near future I will start scraping data and placing it in a JSON file.

# Use
